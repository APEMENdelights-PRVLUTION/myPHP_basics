/*Get a Date
The required format parameter of the date() function specifies how to format the date (or time).

Here are some characters that are commonly used for dates:

d - Represents the day of the month (01 to 31)
m - Represents a month (01 to 12)
Y - Represents a year (in four digits)
l (lowercase 'L') - Represents the day of the week
Other characters, like"/", ".", or "-" can also be inserted between the characters to add additional formatting.
